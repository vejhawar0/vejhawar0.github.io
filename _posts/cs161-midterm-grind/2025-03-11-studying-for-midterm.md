# Chapter 1 
Chapter 1 deals with the idea of fundamental principles regarding security. Note the following down:

1. Know your threat model
2. Consider Human Factors


## Know your threat model
Make a mental picture of the attackers and the kind of resources that they have. With this, we assume that they have any information about your operating system, can attack often to get lucky, have something worth attacking for, and can devote resources, and if they can coordinate complex attacks.

## Consider Human Factors
Security systems are ultimately used a lot by ordinary people. As a result, you have to make the system user friendly. Furthermore, designers are also human and may make mistakes. These are things that you have to keep in mind.
